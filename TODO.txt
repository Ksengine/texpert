Things to do.


File menu (save)
In the file menu, "save as" works fine. But cannot get "save" to work with one click. 
Would like it to automatically overwrite file/document without opening up dialog box. 
Have tried and failed miserably. I think maybe has something to do with how file opens?
Right now, all save and save as buttons are connected to save as.
 

Line/column number only binds to return key. 
Haven't worked on this too much, it could use improvement. 
Like arrow keys, mouse bindings.


Print preview I just started, 
Trying to figure a way to make border/shadow around text (in preview).
